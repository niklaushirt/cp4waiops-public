# 10 Uninstall
---------------------------------------------------------------

‚ùó The scritps are coming from here [https://github.com/IBM/cp4waiops-samples.git](https://github.com/IBM/cp4waiops-samples.git)

If you run into problems check back if there have been some updates.


I have tested those on 3.1.1 as well and it seemed to work (was able to do a complete reinstall afterwards).

Just run:

```
./tools/99_uninstall/3.3/uninstall-cp4waiops.props
```
