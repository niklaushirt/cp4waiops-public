# Create your Slack Workspace

1. Create a Slack workspace by going to https://slack.com/get-started#/createnew and logging in with an email <i>**which is not your IBM email**</i>. Your IBM email is part of the IBM Slack enterprise account and you will not be able to create an independent Slack workspace outside if the IBM slack service.
