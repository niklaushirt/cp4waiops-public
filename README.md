# Welcome to the CloudPak for Watson AIOps Demo Assets

A Story-Telling demo showcasing IBM AIOps with integration of Instana, ELK, Slack, and much more. The story explains how a broken website will be fixed .

Different flavors of this demo are available, reaching from a very flexible, PowerPoint based click-through demo down to your very own installation, so you can pick the level which is most applicable for your situation.

### The different levels of demo that I have made available:

1. ### [Demo it - Shared Demo Environment](#-demo-it---shared-demo-environment)

## 🚀 Show it - Offline Click Through Demo


If you need an easy and fast way to demo AIOps in an "almost real" way you can use the Click Through Demo built with PowerPoint.




The latest versions are [here](https://ibm.box.com/s/icgkxzlt2ja6dth16dpdin055uyysej1) on Box.
