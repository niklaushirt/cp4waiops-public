# Welcome to the CloudPak for Watson AIOps Demo Assets

A Story-Telling demo showcasing Watson AIOps with integration of Instana, Humio, Slack, Event Manager (NetCool Operations Insights - NOI), AI Manager, and much more. The story explains how a broken website will be fixed .

Different flavors of this demo are available, reaching from a very flexible, PowerPoint based click-through demo down to your very own installation, so you can pick the level which is most applicable for your situation.
