# Welcome to the CloudPak for Watson AIOps Demo Assets
A Story-Telling demo showcasing Watson AIOps with integration of Instana, Humio, Slack, Event Manager (NetCool Operations Insights - NOI), AI Manager, and much more. The story explains how a broken website will be fixed .

## Show it - Offline Click Through Demo
If you need an easy and fast way to demo AIOps in an "almost real" way you can use the Click Through Demo built with PowerPoint.


The file is [AIOps INTERACTIVE DEMO 3.2 2021](https://ibm.box.com/s/915h3vnctzlz7ri7bw8qia6b9kc7kogm) in this repository.
You can also find a short quick-and-dirty demo video in the folder.
